"""
Sync Schemas
============
Defines the pull/push contract between the Tauri desktop client and the server.

Ownership rules encoded here:
  Pull-only  (org-level, branch never writes):
      drugs, drug_categories, price_contracts, customers

  Push+Pull  (branch-level, branch is source of truth):
      branch_inventory, drug_batches, stock_adjustments,
      sales, purchase_orders

  Special:
      customers  — org-level but branches CREATE them offline,
                   then push; server deduplicates by phone/email.

  Not synced (server-only):
      insurance_providers, users, suppliers, prescriptions
      — these are managed exclusively through the web admin and
        are not needed offline by the desktop client.
